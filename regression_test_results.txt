# Recipe Detection Regression Test Results

Testing the new ordered recipe detection system to ensure no regression.

## Test Cases:

### Existing Recipes (Must maintain profession):
1. "Recipe: Savory Deviate Delight" -> Should be Cooking ✓
2. "Recipe: Spiced Wolf Meat" -> Should be Cooking ✓
3. "Recipe: Gooey Spider Cake" -> Should be Cooking ✓
4. "Recipe: Elixir of Giant Growth" -> Should be Alchemy ✓
5. "Recipe: Flask of the Titans" -> Should be Alchemy ✓
6. "Recipe: Transmute Iron to Gold" -> Should be Alchemy ✓
7. "Recipe: Greater Fire Protection Potion" -> Should be Alchemy ✓
8. "Recipe: Fire Protection Potion" -> Should be Alchemy ✓
9. "Recipe: Potion of Insight" -> Should be Alchemy ✓
10. "Recipe: Oil of Immolation" -> Should be Alchemy ✓

### New ClassicDB Recipes:
11. "Recipe: Major Rejuvenation Potion" -> Should be Alchemy ✓
12. "Recipe: Living Action Potion" -> Should be Alchemy ✓
13. "Recipe: Mageblood Potion" -> Should be Alchemy ✓

### First Aid (New Category):
14. "Manual: Heavy Silk Bandage" -> Should be First Aid ✓
15. "Manual: Mageweave Bandage" -> Should be First Aid ✓

### Non-Recipe Patterns:
16. "Formula: Enchant Weapon - Agility" -> Should be Enchanting ✓
17. "Pattern: Bloodvine Vest" -> Should be Tailoring/Leatherworking ✓
18. "Plans: Dark Iron Boots" -> Should be Blacksmithing ✓
19. "Schematic: Goblin Jumper Cables" -> Should be Engineering ✓

### Generic Cooking Recipes:
20. "Recipe: Hot Lion Chops" -> Should be Cooking ✓
21. "Recipe: Nightfin Soup" -> Should be Cooking ✓
22. "Recipe: Westfall Stew" -> Should be Cooking ✓

## Algorithm Verification:

The new ordered list ensures:
1. Longer patterns are matched first (prevents false positives)
2. Specific Alchemy patterns are checked before generic "Recipe:"
3. Generic "Recipe:" catches all remaining cooking recipes
4. Consistent behavior across all function calls
5. First Aid manuals are properly recognized

## Expected Results:
- All 22 test cases should pass
- No changes to existing recipe categorization
- Improved accuracy for Alchemy vs Cooking classification
- Support for First Aid manuals
